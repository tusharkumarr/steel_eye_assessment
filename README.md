Creating an API using FastApi in python.

Cretaing local server (uvicorn (app_name):app) in terminal 
Check my api working in Postman app

I generally apply simple apprch for intreating over element in the list and fetching the details accordingly.

1-:Listing trades-> Itreating over over element in list and store the trades in a list and returning list when api calls happen.

2-:Single trade->passing the argument as trade Id and returning the name of the particular trade.

As I was not having any knowledge of RestApi I implemented this by my own in last last day only. And I can also implement is by using mysql database.
